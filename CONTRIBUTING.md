2. 
## Following the procedure you can make your contribution with ease.

### Step 0
Star and Fork this repository

### step 1 Fork this repository
You can fork this repository by clicking on fork button on top right corner. Once you fork this will create a copy of repo on your account

### step 2 Clone the repository
To clone the repository go to your account open this repo and either click on clone button or run the command below to get this repository on your local machine

> git clone <_URL you just copied_>
e.g. git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/learn-dsa.git

### step 3 Get into the App

create a new branch using below command.

### step 7 Push changes to GitHub
Now we have to push the changes that we made to remote repository on specified branch to do so use command below.

> git push origin \<branch-name\>
name of branch is same as you created in step 3

e.g `git push origin mybranch`

### step 8 Submit your changes for review
